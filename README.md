# RL-DynamicPrograming
Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Program(DLND)  
  
Lesson "Dynamic Programming".  
The dynamic programming setting is a useful first step towards tackling the reinforcement learning programing.  
In this lesson, I learned how to implement below algorithms.  
Algorithm 1: Policy Evaluation.  
Algorithm 2: Estimation of Action Values.  
Algorithm 3: Policy Improvement.  
Algorithm 4: Policy Iteration.  
Algorithm 5: Truncated Policy Evaluation.  
Algorithm 6: Truncated Policy Iteration.  
Algorithm 7: Value Iteration.
